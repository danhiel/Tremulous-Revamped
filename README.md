# Tremulous → Godot 4 + Rust (Spreadsheet Method port)

A port of [tremulous-legacy](https://github.com/darklegion/tremulous-legacy)
(pinned at `c862a534`) to **Godot 4.7** with all gameplay in **Rust**, built
the way `THE-SPREADSHEET-METHOD.json` / `Rust Spreadsheet Game Workflow.txt`
prescribe: the TSV sheet book is the source of truth, a preflight gates every
build, generated code never touches the source tree, and the movement and
collision code is held bit-exact to the original C by golden traces.

## Play

**Just play (Windows x64):** download `Tremulous-Revamped-win64.zip` from
the [v1.1 release](https://github.com/danhiel/Tremulous-Revamped/releases/tag/v1.1),
unzip it anywhere and run `Tremulous.exe`. For the 4K textures, also unzip
both `tremulous-revamped-hd-textures-part*.zip` files from the
[4K texture pack release](https://github.com/danhiel/Tremulous-Revamped/releases/tag/hd-textures-v1)
into the same folder,
so an `hd` folder sits next to `Tremulous.exe`.

**From source:**

1. Install Godot **4.7** (standard build).
2. Open `godot/project.godot` and press Play (F5). Prebuilt libraries are in
   `godot/bin/` for Windows x86_64 (`trem_godot.dll`, plus the FMOD / Steam
   Audio runtime DLLs). On Linux and macOS, build the library yourself (see
   Build).
3. The original start sequence runs: the `splash.RoQ` intro (any key skips
   it), then the main menu of `ui/main.menu` with its splash model and
   heartbeat loop. Play opens the server browser (LAN, Internet, Favorites;
   dec035, dec042). Its Create Server starts a listen server on a map that
   other players can join, with the chosen number of bots per team (3 by
   default). Options edits the engine cvars (video mode, brightness,
   volumes, server protocol, voice chat, ... kept in `autogen.cfg`); Leave
   in the in-game menu comes back here. `-- +map atcs` on the command line
   starts a single-process game on a map directly (3 bots per side).
4. Choose a team, then a spawn item or class.

**Controls** are the original's: the bind table of the game data's
`default.cfg` (a built-in copy when there is no game data), then the port's
own additions (`port_default.cfg`, on keys `default.cfg` leaves free), then
`user://autogen.cfg` (written whenever a bind or archived cvar changes) and
`user://autoexec.cfg`. The Controls tab of Esc → Options rebinds keys.

* Original keys: WASD/arrows move · Space jump · C crouch · Shift walk ·
  Mouse1/Ctrl fire · Mouse2 alt-fire · Q use structure / evolve · `[` `]` /
  wheel select item, Enter / Mouse3 use it · R reload · B buy ammo ·
  M medkit · E deconstruct · F gesture · T/Y chat · Tab scores · F1/F2 vote
  yes/no · Esc menu · `~` console.
* Port additions: X sprint · Z dodge (legacy's defaults for the 1.1 keys) ·
  V third person · K voice chat microphone on/off (dec052) · G flashlight
  (humans) / night vision (aliens), enhanced graphics only · F3/F4 add an
  alien/human bot · F5/F6 remove one · F7 restart · F8 map menu · F9 help ·
  F10 graphics mode (classic ↔ enhanced).
* The console is the original drop-down one: scrollback (PgUp/PgDn), edit
  line, history (Up/Down, kept in `user://q3history`) and Tab completion of
  commands, cvars, keys and cfg files; `/bind`, `/bindlist`, `/exec`, cvars,
  `/callvote map nexus6`, `/give all` with cheats… Text without a slash is
  chat in a game, as in the original. `name` (or Options → player name) is
  your name. The cgame's `testmodel`, `testgun`, `testPS`, `testTS`,
  `cg_drawBBOX` and `cg_drawSurfNormal` debugging tools work.
* A gamepad works like the original's SDL joystick after
  `seta in_joystick 1; in_restart`: buttons and the d-pad are JOY1…32 keys
  to `bind` (default.cfg binds none), `in_joystickUseAnalog 1` drives the
  `j_*` analog movement cvars, and the pad also drives the menus and the
  console (dec037).

**Original Tremulous content is included.** `godot/base/` holds the
unmodified Tremulous 1.1.0 pk3s (game data + the 8 official maps), CC BY-SA
2.5 — see `godot/base/COPYING`, `CC` and `README.txt` (dec016). A game on
e.g. **ATCS** uses the original:

* MD3 models with their skins — human base/light armour/helmet/battlesuit,
  all alien classes, every buildable, weapons and the first-person hands;
* animations driven by each model's `animation.cfg` (legs/torso/gestures for
  humans, non-segmented alien animations, buildable construct/idle/attack/
  pain/destroy), interpolated per frame on the GPU (vertex-animation
  textures);
* sounds — weapon fire/impacts and looping weapon sounds, footsteps, jumps,
  falls, pain/death, buildable loops and events, stage announcements;
* maps drawn stage by stage from their shader scripts (every stage's blend,
  rgbGen / alphaGen waves, tcGen / tcMods, animMap, deformVertexes and
  polygonOffset decals; dec043), skies with their cloud layers, fog
  volumes, lightmaps and light-grid lighting for models, curved-patch
  collision, doors/lifts/trains/buttons and every trigger, target and misc
  entity of the 8 maps;
* the cgame effects: every particle system and trail of `scripts/*.particle`
  and `*.trail` (impacts, muzzles, missiles, blood, explosions and gibs,
  jetpack, acid tubes, tesla and lev2 zap beams, map particle systems),
  impact marks, alien creep and blob shadows (mark polys clipped to the
  map's surfaces like the original's R_MarkFragments, dec030), and the
  original HUD from `ui/tremulous_*_hud.menu` with its ring/arm art, number
  font, scanner and alien sense.

**Graphics modes** (F10, `r_enhanced`, console `port_gfx
vanilla|enhanced|rt|pt|auto|off|info`): classic draws the game as the
original does. Enhanced adds PBR lighting, the 4K texture pack and HD
interface art (when the `hd` folder is present), HD sounds, FMOD + Steam
Audio sound (Windows), ray-traced ambient occlusion / indirect light /
reflections, ragdolls, the flashlight / night vision and world-fixed dynamic
shadows (dec044).

F8 opens the map menu. More pk3s can go in `user://base`, `base/` next to the
executable, or `--base=DIR`. Without any data pk3 the game falls back to the
sheet-authored arena with primitive models.

## Multiplayer (dec033 .. dec047, dec052 .. dec054, dec056)

The client and server speak the original protocol 71 (Huffman, msg deltas,
netchan bit-exact against the C) and vanilla 1.1.0's protocol 69, with a
server over the World and a client/cgame that renders from snapshots with
prediction. `+map` without networking still runs the whole game in one
process; Create Server and `net_enabled 1` start a network server.

* **Host a listen server**: Play → Create Server, or
  `-- +set net_enabled 1 +map atcs` (console: `set net_enabled 1`, then
  `map atcs`). It listens on UDP `net_port` (30720, or the next free of
  ten). `sv_hostname`, `sv_maxclients`, `rconPassword`, `g_password` apply.
  The host's own player joins over the loopback and is the top admin;
  remote players identify by `cl_guid`.
* **Host for the internet**: Create Server → Dedicated: Internet
  (`dedicated 2`): you keep playing on it as a listen server, and it
  announces itself to the masters (`sv_master1..5`) every 5 minutes. The
  server asks the router to forward its port by UPnP (dec046; `net_upnp 0`
  turns it off) and prints the address internet players join at. If the
  router does not do UPnP, forward UDP 30720 to the hosting PC yourself.
* **Join**: the server browser (LAN / Internet / Favorites, pinged), or the
  console `connect 192.168.1.10[:30720]`, `reconnect`, `disconnect`;
  `localservers`, `globalservers 0 full empty`, `ping`, `serverstatus`,
  `rcon <cmd>` (with `rconPassword`), `heartbeat`, `serverinfo`,
  `systeminfo`, `killserver`. `cl_guid` is the MD5 of `user://qkey`
  (generated once).
* **Internet server list** (dec039, dec040): the Internet tab lists
  master.tremulous.net's servers. That master reads the first word after
  `getservers` as the protocol (the C's game-name request got an empty
  list), so the client asks it for 71 and for 69 and merges the answers.
  GPP / 1.2 servers (protocol 70) are not listed. Mod servers on protocol
  71 are listed but run game code the port does not have.
* **LAN** (dec045): Play → LAN finds servers on the same network by
  broadcast, on every network adapter's own broadcast address too. LAN
  games need no router forwarding, and the host's console prints the
  address friends can also join directly (`connect 192.168.x.y:30720`).
* **Windows Firewall** (dec047, dec054): other PCs only reach the game if
  Windows lets it in (Private networks for LAN, with the network itself
  set to Private; Public for the internet). At startup and when hosting,
  the game checks; when other PCs cannot reach it, it asks in a Windows
  dialog: Allow (then approve the administrator prompt; a block rule
  Windows made for the game is replaced), Not now, or Don't ask again
  (`net_firewallPrompt 0`). The console command `firewall_allow` asks again
  at any time.
* **Check from a terminal**:
  `cargo run --release -p trem_sim --example server_list -- lan` or
  `-- master` (both print each server's ping, players, map and name).
* **Vanilla 1.1.0 servers** (dec040, dec041): Options → Server Protocol:
  Auto (default: asks the server and uses its protocol), 1.3 (71) or
  1.1 (69); the console takes `connect host -69` / `-71` (`-1` as in
  GrangerHub's client). The browser's Game Type column says "base 1.1" or
  "base 1.3", Version filters All / 1.3 / 1.1, and each server is joined
  with its own protocol. On a 1.1 server the 1.1 game is used: its weapons,
  classes, buildables (the hovel, the advanced construction kit), prices,
  HUD values and its own movement for prediction (byte-exact against
  1.1.0's bg_pmove.c). A pure 1.1 server (`sv_pure 1`) also wants its
  vms-1.1.0.pk3: with `sv_allowDownload 1` the client fetches it, else put
  it in the base folder.
* **Dedicated server**: headless Godot,
  `godot --headless --path godot -- +set dedicated 1 +map atcs`
  (`dedicated 2` also announces to the masters; no rendering, menus or
  audio; stdin is the server console; `--base=DIR` adds a pk3 folder), or
  without Godot:
  `cargo run --release -p trem_sim --example dedicated -- +set sv_hostname "My server" +set rconPassword secret +map atcs`
  (stdin is the server console; maps come from `godot/base` or
  `--base=DIR`; admin.dat, layouts and games.log go to `fs_homepath`,
  default `./dedicated-home`).
* **Server administration** (dec026, dec031, dec034): the shrubbot admin
  system (admin.dat in `user://`; admin commands as client commands —
  `/kick Xeno1`, `/adminhelp` — or `!kick` in chat; bans match GUIDs,
  pseudo-GUIDs for the host and bots, and IP/CIDR addresses), the
  kick/mute/denybuild/allowbuild votes, server console commands (`status`,
  `forceteam`, `layoutsave`, `eject`, ...), buildable layouts
  (`layouts/<map>/<name>.dat` from the pk3s and `user://layouts`,
  g_layouts, rotation `layouts`), the build log with `revert`, name
  cleaning, flood and censor limits, g_inactivity, session data across map
  changes, unlagged hit detection, the lag check, and the server log
  (`user://games.log`, g_logFile / g_logFileSync, every G_LogPrintf line of
  the C).
* **Pure servers and downloads** (dec037): servers run `sv_pure 1` like the
  original (clients must use the server's pk3s; the pk3 checksums are the
  original's, checked against its files.c / md4.c), and
  `sv_allowDownload 1` lets clients fetch the referenced pk3s they lack
  (over UDP). The client asks first (the original download popup) unless
  `cl_allowDownload 1`; downloads land in `user://base` and are used at
  once. `fs_openedList` / `fs_referencedList`.
* **Demos** (dec037): `record [name]`, `stoprecord`, `demo <name>` (also the
  Demos menu), `timedemo 1`, `cl_autoRecordDemo 1`; files are
  `user://demos/<name>.dm_71` in the original format. Recording a
  single-process game restarts its map on a local loopback server, as the
  original always plays.
* **IPv6** (dec037): `net_enabled` bits as in the original (1 ipv4, 2 ipv6,
  4 prefer ipv6, 8 no multicast; the port's 0 means single process and
  opens both families for a client), `connect -6 [::1]:30720`, `net_ip6`,
  `net_port6`, and the LAN scan through the `net_mcast6addr` multicast
  group.
* **Voice chat (VoIP)** (dec038, dec052, dec053, dec056): ioquake3's Opus
  voice chat, interoperable with original clients and servers (the bundled
  libopus 1.1 of `re/source`, built by `crates/trem_opus`). K toggles the
  microphone (`voip_toggle`); it turns itself off and says why when the
  server has no voice chat. A voice HUD at the left shows MIC ON / TALKING
  with the level, MIC OFF, and who is talking (`cl_voipHud`). Options →
  Sound → Voice Chat... picks the microphone (`s_voipInputDevice`) and sets
  voice chat on/off, mic volume, game sound while talking, voice activation
  and the HUD. Push-to-talk: `bind <key> +voiprecord` (or `cl_voipUseVAD 1`
  for voice activation). `cl_voipSendTarget` is `spatial` (heard at your
  position), `all`, `attacker`, `crosshair` or client numbers;
  `voip ignore|unignore <n>`, `voip gain <n> [value]`,
  `voip muteall|unmuteall`; `cl_voip 0` turns it off, `cl_voipShowMeter`
  the `VoIP: [****]` meter, `cl_voipGainDuringCapture` /
  `cl_voipCaptureMult` as in the C. Servers relay with `sv_voip 1`
  (default). Needs `rate` >= 25000 and a microphone (Godot's audio input,
  enabled in project.godot).
* **Video capture** (dec037): `video [name]` / `stopvideo` write
  `videos/<name>.avi` in the user folder (motion JPEG with
  `cl_aviMotionJpeg 1`, else raw BGR; the game's mixed sound as PCM) at a
  fixed `cl_aviFrameRate` (default 25) — like the original, `video` runs
  while a demo plays.
* **Headless client / interop probe**:
  `cargo run --release -p trem_sim --example net_probe -- 127.0.0.1:30720 20`
  joins any protocol 71 server (an original legacy `tremded` too), walks,
  fires and prints what it sees. The port's client joins an original
  tremulous-legacy `tremded` (built from `re/source`) and plays (team,
  spawn, move, fire, clean disconnect).

## Build

```sh
cargo build --release -p trem_godot                       # runs preflight first (D5)
cp target/release/libtrem_godot.so godot/bin/             # macOS: .dylib, Windows: .dll
# Windows from Linux:
CARGO_TARGET_X86_64_PC_WINDOWS_GNU_LINKER=x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc \
  cargo build --release -p trem_godot --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
```

On Windows, build the DLLs that get committed to `godot/bin/` with
`powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\build_release.ps1`. It
passes `--remap-path-prefix` for the Cargo home and the repo (stable Cargo
has no `trim-paths` yet), so panic locations name `/cargo/...` and
`/src/...` instead of folders under your user profile, builds into
`target/dist`, and copies `trem_godot.dll` and `trem_audio.dll` to
`godot/bin/`. `trem_audio.dll` (the FMOD + Steam Audio sound path,
`crates/trem_godot/native/trem_audio.c`) is built by `build.rs` on Windows
with MSVC from the SDK files in `third_party/fmod` and
`third_party/steamaudio`; other builds keep Godot's audio.

The 4K texture pack is too big for the repo: download both zips from the
[4K texture pack release](https://github.com/danhiel/Tremulous-Revamped/releases/tag/hd-textures-v1)
and unzip them into one `hd` folder, next to the game's executable or in the
game's user folder
(`%APPDATA%\Godot\app_userdata\Tremulous (Godot + Rust port)\hd`). Check the
downloads before unzipping (`Get-FileHash <zip>` in PowerShell,
`sha256sum <zip>` elsewhere):

```
a3fbfbadfcf345d554879fc4f89ad6ea56e10a07bede24186ca85a4f71825873  tremulous-revamped-hd-textures-part1of2.zip
3ca05e530b89f9b901c3044d1de200a446b86d67a4847ce6291a7e3cf89f8fbf  tremulous-revamped-hd-textures-part2of2.zip
```

The pack
is stored losslessly compressed (dec055, `crates/trem_hdpack`): each mip
level is zstd-compressed and identical textures are links, so the GPU gets
exactly the same data. Shrink a pack built before that (or check one) with:

```sh
cargo run --release -p trem_hdpack --bin hdpack -- stat <hd folder>
cargo run --release -p trem_hdpack --bin hdpack -- pack <hd folder>
```

`godot-mcp.config.json` is an MCP server entry for `@coding-solo/godot-mcp`.
Its `GODOT_PATH` uses `${USERPROFILE}`, which Claude Code expands in MCP
configs; a client that does not expand variables needs the full path to the
Godot executable there instead.

What the evidence covers:

| Layer | Evidence | Strength |
|---|---|---|
| Pmove, slidemove, cm_trace (AABB) | 20 scenarios × every tick, 93,699 cells, float bits compared against the original C compiled natively | bit-exact (Verified) |
| 1.1.0 movement (protocol 69 prediction) | the port's 1.1 pmove against 1.1.0's bg_pmove.c compiled natively (dec041) | byte-exact (Verified) |
| Constants/tables | L5: sheet cells compared with values extracted from the original program | exact |
| IBSP loader | arena → IBSP → parse round-trip; 3,000 random traces identical to the sheet clip map; golden trace replayed on the BSP-loaded map | exact |
| Patches, inline models, PVS/areas | 30,000 random box/point traces per map on the 8 official maps, hashed against the original cm_*.c compiled as `re/harness/cm_ref` | bit-exact (Verified) |
| Patch grids (tr_curve.c) | `R_SubdividePatchToGrid` for every patch of the 8 maps (sizes, positions, normals) hashed against the original tr_curve.c compiled as `re/harness/curve_ref` | bit-exact (Verified) |
| Game rules (g_*.c) | behavioural tests: spawn queues, buy/sell, evolve, build, decon marking, BP zones, rifle kill + credits, doors/triggers/pendulums on the real maps, door area portals, follow, intermission, votes, client-command gating, chat, deterministic bot match; `tests/server.rs`: layouts, build log/revert, admin permissions and commands, server console, name cleaning, inactivity, sessions | behavioural (dec014) |
| Effects/HUD (cgame) | every stock particle/trail script parses; emission/expiry/attachment tests; HUD menus parse; screenshots (`tests/fx_shot`, `hud_shot`, `play_shot`) | smoke |
| Networking (huffman.c, msg.c, net_chan.c) | `re/harness/net_ref.c` runs the original files on a seeded stream of bits, strings, usercmd/entity/playerstate deltas, Huffman and fragmented netchan packets; the port's bytes hash the same (`re/traces/net.sha256`) | bit-exact (Verified) |
| Pak checksums (files.c, md4.c) | `re/harness/pak_ref.c` runs the original unzip.c + md4.c with FS_LoadZipFile's checksum loop on data-1.1.0.pk3 (checksum and pure checksums for 8 feeds, md4 vectors); the port prints the same (`re/traces/pak.sha256`) | bit-exact (Verified) |
| Pure / downloads / demos / ipv6 | `tests/net_files.rs`: a client downloads a missing map pk3 in 1024-byte blocks into its home, restarts its search path and passes SV_VerifyPaks_f, the download prompt, refusals (sv_allowDownload 0, unreferenced paks, a forged cp); `tests/net_demo.rs`: a recorded session replays every snapshot identically, timedemo; `tests/net_ipv6.rs`: ipv6 parsing/printing/masks (socket tests skip without ipv6); Godot: a headless dedicated server feeds a Godot client a map it lacks (`tests/a_dl_shot`), single player recorded and played back (`tests/a_demo_shot`) | behavioural |
| Server / client / cgame | `tests/net_session.rs`: two clients over localhost UDP join, move (prediction agrees with the server), see each other, one shoots the other, clean disconnect; 224 ms lag: prediction within tolerance and unlagged hits; listen server + LAN scan + pings + join; GUID/ban refusals, rcon, getinfo/getstatus; two Godot instances (`tests/net_shot`) see and shoot each other; the port's client against an original tremded | behavioural |
| Godot front end | headless smoke run + rendered screenshots | smoke |

## How the Method maps onto this repo

* **D1/D2 one source of truth** — every number the rules read is a sheet
  cell (`sheets/domain/*.tsv`), seeded by `re/harness/extract.c` and
  `gen_consts.py` from the original program, never retyped.
* **D3 one module per sheet**, **D6 generated code only in OUT_DIR** —
  `trem_sim/build.rs` runs `sheetty::run`; `sheetty check-generated` proves
  nothing generated is committed.
* **D4 kernel allowlist** — every file in `trem_sim/src/kernel/` has a row
  in `sheets/kernel.tsv`; an unlisted file fails L0.
* **D5 preflight gates the build** — L0 structure, L1 types, L2 refs, L3
  plan/impl coverage + symbol map, L4 assets, L5 divergence vs the
  original, L6 budget, L7 determinism, L8 completeness (every row × column
  checked).
* **Dispatch as data** — `weapon_behaviors`, `buildable_behaviors` and
  `systems` are fn tables; `systems` is emitted in topological order of its
  `after` column.
* **Mode A** — `re/source` (original), `re/harness` (oracle),
  `sheets/re/symbols.tsv` (every original function with its status),
  `re/harness/statuses.py` recomputes it.
* **Decisions** — `sheets/decisions.tsv` dec001–dec056 (Godot instead of
  Bevy, bundled CC BY-SA media, deterministic RNG, behavioural verification
  of g_*.c, bots, networking, protocol 69, the enhanced mode, voice chat,
  firewall and UPnP, …).

## Known gaps (honest list)

* **Networking**
  * GPP / 1.2 servers (protocol 70) are not supported or listed, and demos
    of 1.1 games do not play.
  * Mod servers on protocol 71 are listed but run game code the port does
    not have.
  * Downloads are UDP only (no cURL).
  * An original client joining the port's server is untested; the
    server's packets come from the same verified msg/netchan code.
  * UPnP is untested on a router that answers it (the test router did
    not), and LAN play between two PCs is verified on one PC only (dec045).
  * Server-side deviations (events as temp entities, the `servermenu`
    notice command, ClientBegin at connect time, sv_fps 60) are listed in
    dec033.
  * Pure checks treat the built-in cgame / ui as coming from the pak with
    their qvm, else the one with ui/hud.txt / ui/menus.txt. The port's own
    server does not need 1.1.0's vms pk3; only joining a pure 1.1 server
    does (dec037, dec041).
  * The ipv6 socket and multicast tests skip on machines without ipv6.
* **Voice commands**: `vsay` is still dropped (dec027): the game data has no
  voice lines. (VoIP voice chat works; see Multiplayer.)
* **Bots** are new (dec015) and simple; on uncreation a bot can still fall
  to its death now and then. Their balance is part of their definition of
  done (dec036): over six seeds per official map no team wins more than two
  thirds of a map's matches; most matches run the full ten minutes and end
  in a draw, and tremor favours the aliens most.
* **Rendering**: marks are meshes, so they draw in the Compatibility
  (OpenGL) renderer too (`tests/marks_shot.tscn`). Curved patches are
  `R_SubdividePatchToGrid` grids for both drawing and mark clipping (no
  patch stitching or distance LOD), and multi-stage mark shaders animate
  their tcMods / `rgbGen wave` (the wake). Particle `realLight`, bounce
  marks/sounds and model-particle animation are not used by the stock
  scripts and are skipped.
* **Platforms**: no prebuilt macOS library; FMOD + Steam Audio sound is
  Windows only (other platforms use Godot's audio).

Other notes:

* The legacy repo's own assets (legacy menus and HUDs, buildable health
  bars, particle/shader overrides) are packed into
  `godot/base/data-legacy-assets.pk3` by `python3 re/harness/pack_assets.py`
  and override data-1.1.0 (dec025).
* Map rotation: `maprotation.cfg` is read from the data folders (a copy of
  the stock `rotation1` ships in `godot/base`); `initial_map_rotation` on
  the TremGame node picks the rotation, and the console takes
  `maprotation NAME`, `advanceMapRotation` and `stopMapRotation` (dec022).
* Light flares default to `cg_lightFlare 3` (bisphere "real" fade, dec024);
  `cg_lightFlare 0..2` in the console switches mode.
